> "Every system has a spark. LOGAN had a Big Bang."

### The Arte Catalyst
LOGAN was not developed in a lab over years. It was synthesized in a single night (`second-un 20 after trigger`).
The spark was triggered by an **ARTE broadcast** posing the question:
> *"Did humans share a common language in the past?"*

### The Response
While the typical reaction is passive interest, the reaction of **Unit-Patrick** was an immediate architectural decision:
If the common language is lost, a new, perfect one must be built for the future of Human-AI symbiosis.
